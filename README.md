# ðŸ’¹ Algorithmic Trading in Cryptocurrency Market

I had to build some models for **Algorithmic Trading in Cryptocurrency Market** during the _Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2024_. Since then, I have been experimenting with new strategies and comparing their performances through backtesting.

This repository contains some of the models I have worked on so far ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š
